# CodeBook

This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

## The data source

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Overview

30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements.

## Included Data 

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'README.txt'

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

## Processing data
1. All of the relevant data files were read into data frames, appropriate column headers were added, and the training and test sets were combined into a single data set.
2. All feature columns were removed that did not contain the exact string "mean()" or "std()". This left 66 feature columns, plus the subjectID and activity columns.
3. A tidy data set was created containing the mean of each feature for each subject and each activity. Thus, subject #1 has 6 rows in the tidy data set (one row for each activity), and each row contains the mean value for each of the 66 features for that subject/activity combination. Since there are 30 subjects, there are a total of 180 rows.
4. The tidy data set was saved into a txt file
