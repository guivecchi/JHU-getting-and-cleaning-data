# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Tasks to be done:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to run the R script:
1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip file.
3. Put the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder in the same working directory as the R file.
4. Run source("run_analysis.R"). It will generate a new file "tiny_data.txt" in your working directory.

The dependencies are installed automatically. (First part of the code)
